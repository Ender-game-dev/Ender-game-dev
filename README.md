# Welcome To My Profile ^^

## Some basic information:

- 👋 I’m Ezequiel, from Uruguay
- 👀 I’m passionate about videogames
- 🌱 I’m currently studying front-end development. So far I havent delve into any frameworks, I still exploring the vanilla flavors, but I look forward to learn more in the future!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone who wants to create a project either silly or something more professional. I would love to collab with graphic designers, but... this is GitHub— I doubt there are any graphic designers on the way...
